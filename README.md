### What the LEDS mean

Red = loading/fault

Blue pulsing = power on and successfully running.

blue = Client Connected


### If you can't see the AP-wifi network:
Resart your device, try another phone. insure the red staus led is active, if controller led is not on contact me.


### Connected to AP but captive is not opening:
If your connected and captive is still not opening forget the network, and reconnect. If the issue persists go to the browser and type one of the following 4.3.2.1 or http://captive.apple, while one the network.


### Captive not sending Lock/unlock commands:
please click settings in the top right corner, click restart, once successfully reloaded it should emit a quick beep sound meaning AP is running. if this issue is still present the may be an internal error. 

### device wont power on:
This means the battery is probably low and can't power on, check solar panel is clean and not damaged. if no leds are on that means controller is not running.

### cache led stuck on RED

the led should only remain red for a second or two when pressed meaning its starting. it it stays red it means something went wrong with the config.
